# Image-Classification-CIFAR-10

Description:
Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Classification project powered by PyTorch and ResNet9! In this project, we've developed a deep learning model that achieves an impressive accuracy of 91% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification, containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, making it a challenging task for computer vision.

**Project Highlights:**

- **High Accuracy**: Our PyTorch-based model, utilizing the ResNet9 architecture, boasts a remarkable 91% accuracy in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, showcasing the power of deep learning.

- **Deep Learning with ResNet9**: We leverage the ResNet9 architecture, a variant of the ResNet family of models known for their depth and accuracy. ResNet9 helps us to extract and learn complex features from the images, allowing for accurate classification.

- **GPU Acceleration with CUDA**: To expedite the training process, our project is optimized for GPU acceleration. We utilize CUDA to harness the power of NVIDIA GPUs for faster training and inference.

- **Data Augmentation**: We employ data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data. Augmentation includes random flips, rotations, and adjustments in brightness and contrast, resulting in a more robust and accurate model.

- **PyTorch**: We've implemented the entire project using PyTorch, a widely used deep learning framework that simplifies the development of neural networks and makes it accessible to a broad audience.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: All the code and experiments are documented in Jupyter notebooks, providing a transparent and interactive environment for users to follow along and experiment with their own ideas.

- **Transfer Learning**: We explore transfer learning with the ResNet9 architecture and fine-tune it to further boost our classification performance.

- **Model Visualization**: We visualize the ResNet9 architecture, training history, and confusion matrix to gain insights into model performance.
